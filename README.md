# Open Comic Artist Resource Directory

## Background & mission

It's an open secret in the comics world that the path to becoming a "successful" cartoonist is a rough one. And by success, folks in the industry usually mean the ability to work as a full-time cartoonist *whilst living cheaply*. For more context on this treacherous journey, please see C. Spike Trotman's [This Is Everything I Know: A 24 Hour Comic About Comics](http://spikedrewthis.tumblr.com/post/64136324548/this-is-everything-i-know-a-24-hour-comic-about) or watch [Lucy Bellwood's XOXO 2016 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLveriJBHeU).

The **Open Comic Artist Resource Directory** makes that path a little easier by pooling together resources and research from us and other members of the comics community. Think of it as a slightly more annotated version of The Beat's [How To Get Into Comics and Survive Once Youâ€™re There](http://www.comicsbeat.com/resources/information-on-how-to-get-into-comics-and-survive-once-youre-there/).

If you're looking for a more frequently-updated stream of gigs, opportunities and open calls, we recommend following the wonderful work of [paper cat press](https://papercatpress.com) and [Opportunities for Cartoonists tumblr](http://comicops.tumblr.com/).

## How this works (why GitHub)

We're putting this project on Github because it's the easiest place on the internet today to write collaboratively and publicly:
