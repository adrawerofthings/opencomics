# Open Comics
*Public information and resources for cartoonists*

## Background & mission

It's an open secret in the comics world that the path to becoming a "successful" cartoonist is a rough one. And by success, folks in the industry usually mean the ability to work as a full-time cartoonist *whilst living cheaply*. For more context on this treacherous journey, please see C. Spike Trotman's [This Is Everything I Know: A 24 Hour Comic About Comics](http://spikedrewthis.tumblr.com/post/64136324548/this-is-everything-i-know-a-24-hour-comic-about).

This Open Comics project is about making that path a little bit easier, by pooling our knowledge – all the little tips and tricks that we picked up along the way – together into one public resource. Think of it as the more permanent, text-heavy version of this wonderful [Opportunities for Cartoonists tumblr](http://comicops.tumblr.com/).

## How this works (why GitHub)

We're putting this project on Github because it's the easiest place on the internet today to write collaboratively and publicly. (Wikis have too much overhead and too high a barrier to entry.)
