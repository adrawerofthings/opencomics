# Agents

## Background

### Why have an agent

From [Jane Friedman's blog](https://janefriedman.com/find-literary-agent/):

> In today’s market, probably 80 percent of books that the New York publishing houses acquire get sold by agents. Agents are experts in the publishing industry. They have inside contacts with specific editors and know better than writers what editors or publishers would be most likely to buy a particular work. Perhaps most important, agents negotiate the best deal for you, protect your rights, ensure you are paid accurately and fairly, and run interference when necessary between you and the publisher.
> 
> The best agents are career-long advisers and managers.
> 
> Traditionally, agents get paid only when they sell your work, and they receive a 15 percent commission on everything you get paid (your advance and royalties). It is best to avoid agents who charge fees other than the standard 15 percent.
> 
> So … do you need an agent?
> 
> It depends on what you’re selling. If you want to be published by one of the major New York houses (e.g., Penguin, HarperCollins, Simon & Schuster), then you more or less need to have one—and want one on your side.
> 
> If you’re writing for a niche market (e.g., vintage automobiles) or wrote an academic or literary work, then you might not need an agent. Agents are motivated to take on clients based on the size of the advance they think they can get. If your project doesn’t command a decent advance, then you may not be worth an agent’s time, and you’ll have to sell the project on your own.

### How to get an agent

From [Ryan Holiday's Thought Catalog](http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2014/07/how-to-get-a-book-agent/):

> But look, I can tell you how to find an agent. It’s really simple: Pick 10 books that you like a lot–that either represent the style of writing you aspire to, that match the market you’re working for, or have achieved the success you want. Now look at the Acknowledgments sections of those books (or just use Search Inside on Amazon or Google Books) for where they thank their agent. Which names pop up more than once? Which names do you have a connection with? This connection could be anything–you’ve emailed with one of their clients before, you went to the same college, your uncle does their taxes. Rank your favorites and email them each a week apart–per the instructions on their website–until you get a response.
> 
> That’s seriously it.

### Warning: don't get a bad agent

There are plenty of horror stories around literary agents: *research thoroughly* before making any level of commitment. See Jane Friedman's [blog entry about literary agents](https://janefriedman.com/find-literary-agent/).

Also: look up the agent's company on [Preditors & Editor's Agent & Attorney Listing](http://pred-ed.com/peala.ht), to make sure it's not flagged in red.
